        **Project #2**
          - Created an analysis pipeline to conduct experiments and simulations in order to benchmark the performance of the companies existing toolkit against a proposed improvement 
          - Conducted extensive research of academic literature to calibrate the approach and results
          - Ran comprehensive simulations on high powered VMs and verified our experimental hypothesis, culminating in a detailed report which entailed important strategic business recommendations with significant performance gains and cost savings

        **Other**
          - Conceptualized, pitched and helped launch development of a text mining app
          - Frequently employed statistical methods to infer population parameters from experiments

      Below is a selection of projects which demonstrate my skills in: Python, R, Data Analysis, Report Writing, Scientific Writing and Research. Please click the project names to be redirected.

    assignments:
      - title: CRISPR Data Science Project
        link: "https://github.com/cthutchinson/portfolio/blob/master/CRISPR%20Guide%20Analysis/CRISPR_analysis.ipynb"
        tagline: "Completed as part of my internship application for Desktop Genetics, this project is a good example of my data science and report writing skills. In this project I was tasked with identifying the characteristics of biological agents which resulted in the depletion of cells in the experiment. To complete the task I spent considerable time studying academic literature, annotated the dataset with various bioinformatics tools, performed dimensionality reduction using t-SNE and then clustered the data using DBSCAN."

      - title: Employee Retention Analysis
        link: "https://github.com/cthutchinson/portfolio/blob/master/Employee%20Retention%20Analysis/employee_retention_presentation_callum_hutchinson.pdf"
        tagline: "Completed as part of another internship application, this project required analysis of a dataset to ascertain the characteristics of employees who were leaving a company and development of a model to predict if an employee would leave or not. I succeeded in doing so by exploring and graphing the data in R (tidyverse) and training a decision tree on the data. The data analysis and resultant strategic recommendations are synthesized into the presentation linked above."
      
      - title: NLP Tweet Generator
        tagline: "Awarded best project at the EECS183 (UofM) showcase by representatives from J.P. Morgan, this Python application produces tweets which mimic the style of a specified user. Through the GUI (built using tkinter) an attendee at the showcase could enter a desired twitter handle, at which point the application would use the Reddit API to scrape the profile picture and tweet history of said user. The corpus of tweets would then be tokenized and a Markov model trained on the data to determine the probability of transitioning between words. A sentence could then be probabilistically generated, often with humorous results, and a mock tweet of the user returned via the GUI."

      - title: evofinder
        link: "https://github.com/cthutchinson/evofinder"
        tagline: "A project developed for the evolutionary computation class at UofM, evofinder is an input fuzzer for python programs that attempts to automatically generate inputs to cause the program to reach a pre-specified target location in the control flow graph using an evolutionary algorithm."

      - title: Molecular Dynamics
        link: "https://github.com/cthutchinson/Molecular-Dynamics-Lennard-Jones-cluster-collision-/blob/master/Hutchinson_Report.pdf"
        tagline: "This molecular dynamics simulation and accompanying report was completed as the final project of a computational lab class during my physics degree. I wrote the code from scratch, using the velocity verlet algorithm to numerically integrate Newtons equations of motion."

      - title: Reddit Data Scraping
        link: "https://github.com/cthutchinson/portfolio/tree/master/Reddit%20Scraping"
        tagline: "The Reddit algorithm was of interest to us in our research project concerning feedback loops in ranking systems (see publications below). To analyse the characterists of posts which reached the front pages of Reddit I wrote a Python script using PRAW, urllib2 and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from the first 3 pages of the top 5 subreddits at that time. The collection of this data was important in designing the simulation of posting activity and investigating divergence between 'objective' quality and rank based quality."
